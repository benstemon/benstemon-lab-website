[//]: # (Top section. Spruce this up with Icons, images, etc.)

We aim to understand the evolutionary origins and genetic architecture of phenotypic and ecological variation, primarily in the emerging model plant genus *Penstemon*. We use genomic, phenotypic, and ecological data generated from *in situ* populations and experimental approaches to answer questions about adaptation, speciation, convergent evolution, and species' responses to environmental change.

# Genomics in a rapid continental adaptive radiation


*Penstemon* serves as an exceptional emerging model system to explore key evolutionary questions through diverse approaches including phylogenomics, population genomics, and comparative approaches.

*Penstemon* is the largest angiosperm genus endemic to North America and exhibits an incredible array of phenotypic and ecological diversity across its nearly 300 described species. Floral diversity is considered a key axis of adaptive variation; repeated evolutionary transitions are common in *Penstemon*, with an estimated 20+ independent transitions from bee pollination to hummingbird pollination. There are also many examples of adaptation to specific substrates and habitats such as sand dunes, limestone, and talus/shale/scree.
